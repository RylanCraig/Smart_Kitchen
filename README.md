## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install XAMPP**  
   Download and install XAMPP from the [official site](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

2. **Start the Server**  
   Launch XAMPP and start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the control panel.

3. **Move Files to htdocs**  
   Copy the project folder into the `htdocs` directory within your XAMPP installation.

4. **Set Up the Database**  
   1. Open [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
   2. Create a new database called `smart_kitchen`.
   3. Import the provided `.sql` files located in the `database` section.

5. **Create or Copy HTML and PHP Files**  
   1. You need to create all 6 HTML files as well as the `styles.css` file. Also, you can copy the code for these files from this GitHub repository.
   2. Additionally, make sure to copy all 9 PHP files from this repository to the correct project folder.
   3. **Reminder**: All files (HTML, CSS, and PHP) must be placed in the `htdocs` directory within your XAMPP installation for the app to function correctly.

6. **Open the App Locally**  
   After completing all the above steps, open a live server for your `index.html` file and enjoy your personal Smart Kitchen Web App connected to a local database.
